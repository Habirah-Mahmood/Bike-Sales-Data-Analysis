# Bike-Sales-Data-Analysis (Interactive dashboard Creation Using MS Excel)
This project is about analyzing bike sales data and determining trends and insights based on various customer demographics. This includes examining how factors like gender, income, distance covered, home status, location, and age bracket affect the number of bikes purchased. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel.

## Introduction
The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle, containing details of bike purchases segmented by customer demographics. Our primary task was to analyze and visualize the number of bikes purchased by different groups to identify meaningful trends. By analyzing variables like customer income, gender, distance covered, homeownership status, location, and age bracket, we aim to answer key questions about customer behavior and factors influencing bike sales.

## Key Questions
Our analysis focuses on the following questions:

- How does customer income affect bike purchases across genders?
- Are there any notable differences in bike purchases based on distance covered?
- How do homeownership status and location correlate with bike purchases?
- Are there age-based patterns in bike purchases?

## Data Preparation and Transformation
To ensure accurate and meaningful results, we conducted extensive data cleaning and manipulation:

- Data Cleaning: We identified and removed any duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.
- Column Adjustments: Adjustments were made to key columns such as marital status, gender, and income to standardize values for consistency across the dataset.
- New Columns Added: An additional column, "Age Bracket," was created to categorize customers into relevant age groups, helping us better analyze the effect of age on bike purchases.
- Formatting Standardization: All columns were standardized in terms of formatting to ensure uniformity in analysis.
- Missing Data Handling: We handled missing or incomplete data appropriately to avoid inaccuracies in the final results.

## Analysis and Dashboard Creation
Using Excel's powerful data analysis and visualization tools, we created a dashboard that enables users to interactively explore bike purchase patterns based on different categories. Key features of the dashboard include:

- Income-Based Segmentation: A breakdown of bike purchases by customer income levels.
- Gender Comparison: A visual comparison of bike purchases across male and female customers.
- Travel Distance Influence: Insights into how travel distance correlates with the likelihood of bike purchases.
- Home Ownership Impact: An analysis of bike purchase behavior based on customers' home ownership status.
- Location & Age Bracket: Charts displaying bike purchases segmented by location and age group.

## The Created Dashboard


## Results
Our dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the bike sales trends across various demographics. By examining the relationships between these factors, we can identify potential target segments for marketing efforts and uncover customer preferences that could drive future business strategies.

## Conclusion
Through a combination of data cleaning, transformation, and dashboard creation, we've transformed a raw dataset into actionable insights that highlight patterns in bike purchases based on key demographic and behavioral factors.
